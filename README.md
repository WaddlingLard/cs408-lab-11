# Lab 11

## Overview

This is rough website that allows you to interact with an DB using AWS Lambda functions!

There is a lot of code to take in and many strategies used to solve the lab's requirements. I even snuck in some async into the script. :)

Steps to run the website:
1. To get this website running, first download this repository to your local directory.
2. Navigate to where it is located on your computer and then open VSCode.
3. Then, using Live Preview, use the key combination ctrl+shift+p and use the command 'Live Preview: Start Server'.
4. If you want to access the website via a web browser. User the url 'localhost:3000' to view the website.
